# Generative Data Analytics using Three.js and Next.js with API Endpoint

This project is a creative way of visualizing data from an API endpoint using the combination of Three.js and Next.js. The geometric shapes in the visualization change dynamically based on the data retrieved from the API.
Features

- Dynamically changing geometric shapes based on data from API endpoint.
- Interactive 3D visualization using Three.js
- Server-side rendering with Next.js for fast and responsive visualization.
- Easy setup and customization.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
Clone this repository.
Install the dependencies using npm install.
Create a .env.local file in the root of the project and add the API endpoint URL like this:

javascript

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-endpoint-url.com

    Run the project using npm run dev.

    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the visualization.

Usage

Once you have the project running, you can customize the visualization to suit your needs. You can change the shapes, colors, and other properties of the 3D objects by modifying the code in the components/Shape.js file.

You can also change the way the data is retrieved and processed from the API by modifying the code in the pages/index.js file.
